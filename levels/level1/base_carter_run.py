"""LEVEL 1 mission runner - full-lane drive + arrival pose alignment.

MISSION (scenarios/nova_carter_warehouse_level1.yaml):
  The Nova Carter spawns at world (-6.0, -1.0) facing yaw=pi (-x direction).
  The goal (-6.0, 5.0) lies 6.0 m away along the +y warehouse lane (the lane
  is free the whole way - probe-verified).  Drive there, arrive facing
  yaw=+1.5708 (+y), and never touch anything on the way.

PASS CRITERIA (evaluated by the fixed harness, not by this file):
  reached_goal   final distance <= 0.75 m AND |yaw error| <= 0.26 rad
  no_collision   zero chassis contact events (self + floor excluded)
  timeout_s      120 s of sim time

ROBOT API available to the controller:
  controller(t, pose, env) is called once per 1/60 s sim step and must
  return (v, w, done):
    t     sim seconds since mission start
    pose  (x, y, yaw) ground-truth world pose of the chassis
    env   harness handle: env.raycast_scan(n_beams, fov_deg, z, max_range)
          -> [(bearing_rel_to_heading, distance_m), ...]  (not needed at L1)
    v     forward velocity command [m/s] on /cmd_vel
    w     yaw rate command [rad/s] on /cmd_vel
    done  True ends the mission (harness then stops the robot and evaluates)

The ONLY part meant to be modified to solve the level is the block marked
[EDIT REGION].  Everything outside it is fixed plumbing, identical between
base_carter_run.py and solution_carter_run.py.
